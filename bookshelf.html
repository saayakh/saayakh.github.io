                This section contains books that I am currently reading or have read, and have found helpful/interesting. 
                This is partly for my own "bookkeeping". These books haven't been organized in any priority order or genre (yet).

              A really comprehensive textbook/reference on neuropharmacology by Prof. Eric Nestler. 
              The book, however, requires a basic understanding of cell and molecular biology, as well as pharmacology.

              <summary>7. "The Night Train at Deoli"- A short story by Ruskin Bond</summary>
              <p>
                  Everything about Ruskin Bond is so elegantly simple—his stories, his storytelling, as well as the contents; 
                  yet his writing reminds us that it is the simple things in life that can be so enthralling.
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                  "...She did not go down the length of the train selling baskets, but came straight to the tea stall; her dark eyes were suddenly filled with light. 
                  We said nothing for some time but we couldn’t have been more eloquent."
              </blockquote>
              <p>
                  This is what I love about Ruskin Bond—human beings experience a spectrum of fleeting emotions—some of which are, perhaps, incomprehensible even to ourselves. 
                  He doesn't invoke any complex wordings or plots—yet pens them down so subtly.
              </p>

                  On another note, this story also reminds me of some words and concepts from <em>The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows</em>:<br>

              <summary>7. Srikanta by Sarat Chandra Chattapadhyay</summary>
              <p>
                  One of the handful of authors whose works I have extensively read, Sarat Chandra weaved the intricacies of everyday life, joy, 
                  and sorrows into astonishingly moving yet simple stories and novels. He worked as a petty clerk, and produced some of the most celebrated Bengali literature of that time.

              <summary>6. The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran</summary>
              <p>
                  Kahlil Gibran was a Lebanese-American philosopher and poet (and artist). His works have endeavored a subtle syncretism rare in that era. 
                  I read several of his books while in high school; I was, perhaps, too young to appreciate some of his works then, but I learnt a great deal of prosody from his writings.

              <summary>5. Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse</summary>
              <p>
                  Written by German author Hermann Hesse, this novel weaves an imaginative and tranquil discourse about the life of an ascetic, contemporary to Gautama Buddha. 
                  There is this excerpt that still enthralls me:
              </p>
              <blockquote>
                  "The many-voiced song of the river echoed softly... Siddhartha listened... He'd often heard all this before, all these numerous voices in the river, but today they sounded different. 
                  He could no longer distinguish the different voices... They all belonged to each other: the lament of those who yearn, the laughter of the wise... 
                  All of them together was the world. All of them together was the stream of events, the music of life."
