  A really comprehensive textbook/reference on neurophamacology by Prof. Eric Nestler. The book, however, requires a basic understanding of cell and molecular biology, as well as pharmacology.

  <summary>7. "The night train at Deoli and other stories" by Ruskin Bond</summary>
  Everything about Ruskin Bond is so elegantly simple- his stories, his storytelling, as well as the contents; yet his writing reminds us that it is the simple things in life that can be so enthralling.
  This book is a collection of short stories. These few lines from "The Night Train at Deoli"-
  "...She did not go down the length of the train selling baskets, but came straight to the tea stall; her dark eyes were suddenly filled with light. We said nothing for some time but we couldn’t have been more eloquent."

  "...Somehow, I couldn’t bring myself to break journey at Deoli and spend a day there. (If it was all fiction or a film, I reflected, I would have got down and cleaned up the mystery and reached a suitable ending for the whole thing). I think I was afraid to do this. I was afraid of discovering what really happened to the girl. Perhaps she was no longer in Deoli, perhaps she was married, perhaps she had fallen ill …
In the last few years I have passed through Deoli many times, and I always look out of the carriage window, half expecting to see the same unchanged face smiling up at me. I wonder what happens in Deoli, behind the station walls. But I will never break my journey there. It may spoil my game. I prefer to keep hoping and dreaming, and looking out of the window up and down that lonely platform, waiting for the girl with the baskets.
I never break my journey at Deoli, but I pass through as often as I can."

This is what I love about Ruskin Bond- human beings experience a spectrum of fleeting emotions- some of which are, perhaps, incomprehensible even to ourselves. He doesn't invoke any complex wordings or plots- yet pens them down so subtly.
On another note, this story also reminds me of some words and cpncepts from The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows-
Dès Vu: The Awareness That This Moment Will Become a Memory

Onism: The Awareness of How Little of the World You’ll Experience

  <summary>7. Srikanta by Sarat Chandra Chattapadhyay</summary>
  One of the handful of authors whose works I have extensively read, Sarat Chandra weaved the intricacies of everyday life, joy, and sorrows into ashtonishingly moving yet simple stories and novels. He worked as a petty clerk, and produced some of the most celebrated Bengali literature of that time.

  <summary>6. The Prophet by Kahlil Gibran</summary>
  Kahlil Gibran was a Lebaneese-American philosopher and poet (and artist). His works have endeavored a subtle syncretism rare in that era. I read several of his books while in high school; I was, perhaps, too young to appreciate some of his works then, but I learnt a great deal of prosody from his writings.

  <summary>5. Siddhartha by Hermann Hesse</summary>
  Written by German author Hermann Hesse, this novel weaves a imaginative and tranquil discourse about the life of an ascetic, contemporary to Gautama Buddha. I read this book while I was 17 ish years old. There is this excerpt that still enthralls me-

"The many-voiced song of the river echoed softly...

Siddhartha listened. He was now listening intently, completely absorbed, quite empty, taking in everything. He felt that he had now completely learned the art of listening. He'd often heard all this before, all these numerous voices in the river, but today they sounded different. He could no longer distinguish the different voices--the merry voice from the weeping voice, the childish voice from the manly voice. The all belonged to each other: the lament of those who yearn, the laughter of the wise, the cry of indignation and the groan of the dying. They're all interwoven and interlocked, entwined in a thousand ways. And all the voices, all the goals, all the yearnings, all the sorrows, all the pleasures, all the good and evil, all of them together was the world. All of them together was the stream of events, the music of life."
